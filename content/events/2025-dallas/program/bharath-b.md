As organizations struggle to operationalize their AI investments—with only 20% of machine learning models making it to production—the MLOps discipline has become critical for transforming experimental algorithms into scalable, reliable systems. This presentation tackles the fundamental challenge of building robust ML pipelines that bridge the gap between data science experimentation and enterprise-grade deployment. Drawing from hands-on experience implementing MLOps frameworks across cloud-native architectures, this session will deconstruct the essential components of successful ML system integration. Participants will explore automated model training pipelines that reduce deployment time by 80%, discover monitoring and observability patterns that prevent model drift in production environments, and understand CI/CD practices specifically designed for machine learning workflows. The presentation focuses on practical MLOps implementation using modern cloud platforms and open-source tools, demonstrating how to build end-to-end automation that scales from prototype to production. Real-world case studies showcase integration patterns for model versioning, automated testing, and continuous deployment across containerized environments. Key technical areas covered include:

ML pipeline orchestration using tools like Kubeflow, MLflow, and Apache Airflow for automated training and deployment Model monitoring and drift detection systems that maintain 95%+ accuracy in production environments Infrastructure as Code patterns for reproducible ML environments across development, staging, and production Integration strategies for real-time inference systems handling high-throughput prediction requests Automated testing frameworks for ML models including data validation, model performance, and system integration tests

Attendees will gain actionable insights for implementing MLOps practices that reduce time-to-production, improve model reliability, and enable continuous integration of AI capabilities into existing system architectures. This session is designed for ML engineers, DevOps practitioners, and system architects working to operationalize machine learning at scale.
